description: 🟩 59 hackers, 1121 commits, and a lot more fun!
---

We've been running Commit Overflow for a while now — since [2022](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/commit-overflow-2022)! It's our annual event where we challenge our community to make daily progress on their personal projects over winter break ❄️.

## Energy off the charts

This winter's energy was off-the-charts! We had **59** hackers, **1121** commits, and **6871** messages sent! It's become our annual winter ritual, which always has a lively turnout. People push each other to keep going, share updates, and cheer each other on!

## Open source, as always

As with everything we do, Commit Overflow is fully open source. We built new tooling this year to make the event more transparent and fun, and you can explore all of it yourself:

- Website code: [purduehackers/commit-overflow-website](https://github.com/purduehackers/commit-overflow-website)
- Discord bot: [purduehackers/wack-hacker](https://github.com/purduehackers/wack-hacker/blob/main/src/features/commit-overflow/index.ts)

## Conclusion

This was our largest Commit Overflow yet, and a clear signal of how much Purdue Hackers has grown! Seeing so many people choose to spend winter break building, learning, and shipping together is so incredibly motivating :) We’re excited to keep iterating on the format and see what the folks create next year!
