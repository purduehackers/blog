description: 🟩 59 hackers, 1121 commits, and a lot more fun!
---

We've been running Commit Overflow for a while now — since [2022](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/commit-overflow-2022)! It's our annual event where we challenge our community to make daily progress on their personal projects over winter break ❄️.

## Energy off the charts

This winter's energy was off-the-charts! We had **59** hackers, **1121** commits, and **6871** messages sent! It's become our annual winter ritual, which always has a lively turnout. People push each other to keep going, share updates, and cheer each other on!

## Community highlights

With nearly 60 participants, this year brought more breadth than ever before. People worked across web development, hardware projects, art, and half-baked ideas that finally got the attention they deserved.

### Verilog to Minecraft Compiler

If you have ever worked with an FPGA before, you are likely familiar with [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog). It is
a language used to create circuits and processors. If you have played Minecraft, you might be familiar with Redstone. DitrusNight
was able to create a Verilog to Minecraft Redstone compiler where you give it Verilog and it outputs a corresponding Minecraft
Redstone circuit. They were able to make functional RAM and ROM components with this project.

### 3d Action RPG

[Pranav](https://github.com/Privnoval016) worked on his 3D Action RPG. This required a large mix of different skill sets, from development, to 3d modeling, and even music production.

### 2D Printer

Most people are familiar with 3D printers. Imagine if we had a 3D printer but it was only 2 dimensions. [Madhav](https://github.com/MadhavVP)
made [just that](https://github.com/MadhavVP/2D-Printer) by taking 3D printer parts and removing the vertical axis.
Instead of the traditional way that printers works, it uses a pen to draw the images.

### Calculator Programming Language

We can't forget the projects that teach you fundamental CS concepts. [Daniel](https://github.com/ninebitcomputer)
made [a calculator language in Rust](https://github.com/ninebitcomputer/ro). Creating a programming language is not a trivial
task and even just turning the code into something the computer can work with requires a lot of learning.

### Art!

So many artists participated in CommitOverflow! Here is just a selection of the different things people made and links to them.

## Open source, as always

As with everything we do, Commit Overflow is fully open source. We built new tooling this year to make the event more transparent and fun, and you can explore all of it yourself:

- Website code: [purduehackers/commit-overflow-website](https://github.com/purduehackers/commit-overflow-website)
- Discord bot: [purduehackers/wack-hacker](https://github.com/purduehackers/wack-hacker/blob/main/src/features/commit-overflow/index.ts)

## Conclusion

This was our largest Commit Overflow yet, and a clear signal of how much Purdue Hackers has grown! Seeing so many people choose to spend winter break building, learning, and shipping together is so incredibly motivating :) We’re excited to keep iterating on the format and see what the folks create next year!
