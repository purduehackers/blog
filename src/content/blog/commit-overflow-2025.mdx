description: 🟩 59 hackers, 1121 commits, and a lot more fun!

We've been running Commit Overflow for a while now — since [2022](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/commit-overflow-2022)! It's our annual event where we challenge the community to make daily progress on their personal projects over winter break❄️.

The energy was off-the-charts — literally, as you'll see below. With our community now some 3,000 members strong, we had **59** hackers, **1121** commits, and **6871** messages sent!

The community did _many_ exciting things this year! Having nearly 60 people participate brought a lot more breadth to Commit Overflow than past years.

There was lots of hardware-related work: hacking on [advent of FPGA](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/), creating a Verilog to Minecraft compiler, a 2D printer and a robot for manipulating Rubik's cubes.

There was a lot of software work: working on a VR videogame, graphics shaders for websites, blog posts, development on a new programming language ([amazingly related to the rubik's cube robot](https://qter.dev/)), a new game engine among many others.

There was a lot more art this year: characters, paintings, and many doodles!

New this year was the addition of our omni-bot _Wack Hacker_. Wack H. allowed members to query their commit totals, streaks, adjust their timezones, and all manner of other administrative tasks that previously fell to Organizers.

We also got a website to see the club's progress as a whole at [https://commitoverflow.purduehackers.com](https://commitoverflow.purduehackers.com). Fun fact: the website was developed _during_ Commit Overflow, and many git commits to the website were commits to Commit Overflow as well!

This year's Commit Overflow was our largest yet. Purdue Hackers has grown a lot over the years, and seeing so much work over winter break is great proof of that!
