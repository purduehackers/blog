HELLO THERE! You're probably here because you just read one of our posts and tried to find out what other cool things we've
written about. Glad you found us!

We haven't set up an RSS feed for this blog yet, so right now the only way to stay updated on what we're doing is by following us
on social media:

- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/purduehackers)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/purduehackers)

If you want to get in touch, you can reach us at `purduehackers [at] gmail [dot] com`.

If you go to Purdue, we'd love to see you at our next event—[find out when it's happening here.](https://events.purduehackers.com) We'd also love to have you in [our Discord](https://puhack.horse/discord).

If you represent a business and want to help us continue building a space for Purdue students to create things—whether it be a donation,
an in-kind sponsorship, or a joint event—please reach out to us at the email above or to me directly (`mstanciu [at] purdue [dot] edu`).

See you around the universe!

💛 Matthew
